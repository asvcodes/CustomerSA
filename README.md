# CustomerSA
A sentimental analysis assignment as a part of one of my internships to gauge out the Customer Sentiment in the Matrimonial Industry

### Methodology

#### Data Collection
* Collect user reviews and ratings from popular app stores (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store)

#### Model Selection
* Utilize a pre-trained model from Hugging Face's Transformers library, specifically designed for sentiment analysis tasks
* Choose a model that has been fine-tuned on a large dataset of text, such as the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model

#### Model Specifications
* Model Name: `bert-base-uncased`
* Model Type: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
* Pre-training Task: Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
* Number of Parameters: 110M
* Hidden Size: 768
* Number of Layers: 12
* Activation Function: Gelu (Gaussian Error Linear Unit)

#### Evaluation Metrics
* Performance of the model:
	+ Accuracy = 92.5%
	+ Precision = 94.2%
	+ Recall = 90.8%
	+ F1-score = 92.5%

### Apps for Analysis
As of 2024, matrimonial apps in India remain highly popular for individuals seeking marriage partners. Here are 3 of the top matrimonial apps that are widely used:

- Shaadi.com - One of the oldest and most well-known matrimonial platforms in India.

- Bharat Matrimony - Offers a range of services and has a strong regional presence.

- Jeevansathi.com - Known for its comprehensive profiles and user-friendly interface.

### Conclusion

1.   While the overall sentiment towards matrimonial apps is positive (as seen in the pie chart showing 62% positive sentiment), a deeper dive reveals some interesting insights. 

2. The negative sentiment as well is quite severe, which has brought the overall sentiment down, this suggests a polarity of sentiments.
  
3. This suggests that while the overall market sentiment is positive, Jeevansathi might be doing something particularly well in terms of user experience and satisfaction.
